            "question":"Among the many mysteries of modern world, the Dyatlov Pass incident takes up a top spot due to its gruesome and strange nature.\n In 1959, a group of students from the Ural Polytechnical Institute went on a hike to Mount Ortorten in Russia's Ural mountains. They were later found dead in different circumstances, some with missing eyes and tongues, a strange orange hue to their corpses and serious injuries. \n\nAliens, a secret Russian military program and even Yeti was proposed as possible reasons. \n\nBut a localised avalanche was the most plausible explanation according to experts. \n\nOn March, 2022, Johan Gaume and Alexander M. Puzrin of the ETH Zurich published a paper saying that an avalanche was the reason behind their death. \n\nThe duo had used a 'proprietary' version of a  snow-modelling algorithm from an American giant to help in their study - Gaume had already seen its potential in modelling frozen climates in 2013 in its use by the company and thought it could serve as the suitable tool for their study. \n\nHe therefore used it to create simulation of the Kholat Saykhl avalanche, to understand its impact on the human body. \n\nWhere exactly did they get the code from?",
